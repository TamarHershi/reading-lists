# Reading Lists

I created this application over Thanksgiving break as part of our class assignment to make a simple rails app.

This application allows the user to create different reading lists and to add books to those lists. Users can mark whether books are read or unread.

This was a quick project, so there is a lot of functionality that could be added. Here are some ideas:
- easier editing of which books are in a reading list
- ratings and reviews for books
- photos for books
- extend project to movies, etc.
