# Reading Lists

I created this application over Thanksgiving break as part of our class assignment to make a simple rails app.

This application allows the user to create different reading lists and to add books to those lists. Users can mark whether books are read or unread.

I did this one as a pretty throwaway project, so there is a lot of functionality that could be added, here are some ideas:
- easier editing of which books are in a reading list
- ratings and reviews for books
- photos for books
- extend project to movies, etc.
